# GWindow
A better SimpleGraph but cleaner (and some other stuff) :D
# How to use
Make sure not to run any code in the legacy file! That's the version

that uses memory magic to store information.

Just do ./build.sh to run and make sure to have clang++ and x11 on

your system.
# Stuff
> Uses rasterization techniques from: https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/rast1.html

# Documentation
Just read the graphics.hpp and graphics.cpp file

to understand all the features :-)
# What will I do with this?
I'm working on making a cool card video game
